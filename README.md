#Project Description

Problem - In Sri Lanka there are more poor people who need the support of the other oneâ€™s who are having. Donators 
cannot identify/find the people who need the support. There should be a bridge to have the connection between them. also 
there are poor ones who are without jobs and also likes to follow free courses. 

Solution - Although there are many ways for donations, there is no much online mode to make donations in sri lanka. 
Donators can do donations and also needy people could request for donations via a 3rd party. They can get a job posted 
like to start a sole business. And also can follow free courses. All in one package for needy ones.
